# simple-python-slots-game
A simple slot machine game created in python. original code was taken from https://github.com/techwithtim @techwithtim but I couldn't get it to work correctly. I am learning so I'm quite sure it can be improved upon (and intend to try to do so)   .
This is my first use of github so I may not have done everything correctly. Any comments/suggestions will be appreciated ;)
